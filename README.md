# Focus Stacking and Occlusion Removal

This project is dedicated to the development of a machine learning model capable of performing focus stacking to create images with extended depth of field and occlusion removal to enhance image quality by removing unwanted objects.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.10 (higher isn't possible since pytorch doesn't support it)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation), a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python.

### Installing

To set up the project environment and install the required dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/theGreatRaphael/cv-project.git
cd focus-stacking-and-occlusion-removal
```


2. **Install Dependencies with Poetry**
```bash
poetry install
```

This command reads the `pyproject.toml` file from the current project, resolves the dependencies, and installs them.


3. **Activating the Virtual Environment**

```bash
poetry shell
```

This command spawns a shell within the virtual environment. Any Python command you run will now use your projectâ€™s isolated environment.

### Usage

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system, how to train the model, or any other relevant information.

### Data Files

The data files for focus stacking can be found at the following link: [Image Data Files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l9CAvtcN4FT_h77Qi1rCfqtY29po_T6y?usp=sharing)

Please ensure that you have the necessary permissions to download and use the data.
